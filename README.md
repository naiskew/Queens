Queens
======

Classic Chess Queens problem.
Try to place the number of queens on an empty chess board so that no queen is "attacking" any other.
I program it with HTML, JavaScript, 
JQuery = jquery-1.8.3.js (need to edit the address on queen.php file line 3) , 
PHP = todoproc.php (need to edit the address on queen.php file line 23) , 
and MySQL = I run it on my web server so the machine that run this program need to have MySQL install.
